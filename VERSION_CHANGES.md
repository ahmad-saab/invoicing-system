# Version 2 Changes - August 12, 2025

## Summary
Enhanced PDF parsing debug capabilities with comprehensive extraction improvements. This version addresses critical parsing limitations where only 10 lines of a 35-line PDF were being processed, missing product data in the middle sections. The parsing limit has been increased to 1000 lines with enhanced debug output for complete PDF content analysis.

## Files Modified
- `api_server.py` - Enhanced debug output for PDF parsing with 1000-line limit
- `mapping_parser.py` - Improved table extraction and text processing 
- `frontend/src/components/ParseTester.js` - Enhanced debug interface showing all unmapped content

## New Features
- **Enhanced PDF Debug Output**: Complete PDF text extraction showing up to 1000 lines
- **Comprehensive Debug Interface**: Full Python debug output in frontend with detailed breakdown
- **Complete Product Line Extraction**: Parser now captures all product lines from table-formatted content
- **Advanced Table Detection**: Multiple table extraction strategies for borderless tables
- **Real-time Parsing Metrics**: Shows exact extraction statistics and confidence scores

## Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Parsing Limit**: Raised from 10 lines to 1000 lines for complete PDF content
- **Fixed Missing Product Data**: Enhanced extraction captures product lines in middle sections
- **Fixed Debug Output Truncation**: Complete unmapped text now visible for debugging
- **Fixed Table Extraction**: Improved handling of table-formatted product data
- **Fixed Product Name Cleaning**: Better matching with customer mappings

## Technical Changes
- **Enhanced API Logging**: Complete PDF text extraction logged to console with page-by-page analysis
- **Improved Frontend Debug**: Real-time display of all extracted content with line-by-line breakdown
- **Database Schema Updates**: Customer pricing system with pricing_history and customer_pricing tables
- **Advanced Customer Pricing**: User-controlled pricing overrides with VAT configuration
- **Multi-factor Customer Matching**: Email-based identification with address and name matching

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies added
- Existing dependencies: pdfplumber, FastAPI, React, SQLite

## Testing Notes
- System successfully extracts content from 35-line PDFs showing all product lines
- Enhanced debug output helps identify mapping issues
- Customer pricing system allows price overrides for accurate invoice generation
- Parser handles both simple and complex PDF table structures

## Known Issues
- PDF parsing may show FontBBox warnings (non-critical, from pdfplumber library)
- Complex table structures may still require manual mapping verification
- Processing time increases with larger PDFs due to comprehensive extraction

## Rollback Instructions
If this version has issues:
1. Stop all services: `pkill -f api_server.py && pkill -f "npm start"`
2. Copy files from previous version folder: `cp -r invoice_system_version_1/* ./`
3. Restart services: `./start_app.sh`

## Customer Pricing System
- **Database-Driven Pricing**: Users control product pricing through UI interface
- **VAT Configuration**: Per-customer VAT rates and inclusive/exclusive settings
- **Price Source Tracking**: System tracks whether prices come from PDF or database
- **Historical Pricing**: All price changes logged with timestamps and reasons
- **Multi-Currency Support**: AED, USD with customer-specific defaults

## PDF Parsing Improvements
- **Complete Text Extraction**: Every line from PDF now processed and available for debugging
- **Table Recognition**: Enhanced detection of table-formatted product data
- **Debug Transparency**: Frontend shows exactly what text was extracted and how it's being processed
- **Mapping Integration**: Better connection between parsed text and customer-defined mappings
- **Quality Metrics**: Confidence scores and success rates for parsing accuracy

This version represents a major improvement in parsing capabilities and debugging transparency, directly addressing user feedback about incomplete PDF content extraction.
